        <h4>Time Pal</h4>
        <div>July, 2017</div>
        <p>
          <div>
            Built an intelligent Slack bot that can schedule reminders and meetings in Google Calendar
            using natural language processing queries. Designed interactive process for statefully
            managing multi-step chat interactions using Slack’s Real-time Messaging API and Google’s API.AI
            that allows for a friendly bot interface to schedule conflicts, cancellations, and confirmations.
            Scheduled batch job using Heroku and devised unified OAuth flow for Google Calendar.

        <div>August, 2017</div>
        <p>
          <div>
            Built contentEditable rich-text editor desktop app using React codebase that allows for real-time editing
            and collaboration built using Web Sockets. Modular designed the single-page app with client-side
            routing and webpack and used Electron to create a desktop app. Built RESTful backend Web Server API.

          <h4>What it does:</h4>
          <div>
            I built this car as a final project for UC Berkeley's EE16B with a partner where
            we used different circuit elements such as Resistors, Op-Amps, and Capactiors to build
            the hardware and then used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Controls
            to program the car to respond to voice commands.

        <h4>Google Maps</h4>
        <div>July, 2016</div>
        <img src="/images/bear_maps_demo.png" style="width: 800px;height:400px;">
        <p>
          <h4>What it does:</h4>
          <div>
            Used Google Maps API to create my own rendition for the city of Berkeley. Displays
            traffic layers, has walking, biking, and transit transportation options, can do
            auto-completion when entering place names, finds the shortest path from starting
            point to destination, displays step by step directions to destination, and allows
            users to zoom in and out of the map.

        <h4>Scheme Interpreter</h4>
        <div>April, 2016</div>
        <p>
          <div>
            Built an interpreter using the Python language for translating Scheme language code. Evaluates submitted Scheme expressions.

        <h4>Maze Mobile Virtual Reality Game</h4>
        <div>December, 2016</div>
        <img src="/images/maze.png"
              style="width:700px;height:400px;">
        <p>
          This was a personal project I worked on during winter break to learn and practice how to make Virtual Reality applications.

          <h4>What it does:</h4>
          <div>
            This is a mobile Google Cardboard application where players navigate through
            a maze using a waypoint-based navigation system in which players "teleport to different
            parts of the maze" and collect coins and a key in order to open the gate to win.

          This was a personal project I worked on during winter break to learn and practice how to make Virtual Reality applications.

          <h4>What it does:</h4>
          <div>
            This is a mobile Google Cardboard application where players navigate through
            a puzzle that is adapted from the game Simon Says, which prompts users with an
            interface that challenges them to memorize the patterns of lightbulbs flashing
            to solve the game.

        <p>
          I did this project at Cal Hacks held at UC Berkeley with one other person.

          <h4>What it does:</h4>
          <div>
            We have provided an API which will allow users to use our molecular representations for
            further projects. Of particular importance is the Molecule class, which stores a collection
            of Atoms, linking/bonding them together via a graph data structure. The Molecule class
            provides a wide variety of utilities that can be assembled together for more complicated
            chemical processing.
